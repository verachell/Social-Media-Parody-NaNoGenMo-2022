I always thought _SPECJOBSPLURAL_ were _EVIL_, now I know for sure
everyone knows that the _SPECJOBSPLURAL_ are trying to _SPECEVILGOAL_
_SPECJOBSPLURAL_ should not own a _TOTD_
shocked beyond belief that people want to _SPECEVILGOAL_. Guess I shouldn't have been surprised that it was the _SPECJOBSPLURAL_
did you know that they are trying to use a _TOTD_ to _SPECEVILGOAL_?
it makes sense that it's the _SPECJOBSPLURAL_ who want to use a _TOTD_ to _SPECEVILGOAL_
I saw a _SPECJOBS_ with a _TOTD_ yesterday! Very suspicious
if _SPECJOBSPLURAL_ manage to _SPECEVILGOAL_, it's going to harm everyone
the _TOTD_ is _EVIL_
don't have anything to do with a _TOTD_
I'm worried what _EVIL_ stuff will happen if the _SPECJOBSPLURAL_ manage to _SPECEVILGOAL_ with a _TOTD_
I'm definitely concerned about the _TOTD_
I've lost faith in humanity now that there are a group of _EVIL_ people trying to _SPECEVILGOAL_
it's a no-brainer that it's _EVIL_ to _SPECEVILGOAL_
