I don't think there's a conspiracy. How could the _SPECJOBSPLURAL_ keep such a secret when there's so many of them?
if anyone wants to _SPECEVILGOAL_, why is a _TOTD_ needed to do it? I don't see the link
I'm not convinced this idea holds together well. Why would _SPECJOBSPLURAL_ want to _SPECEVILGOAL_ anyway?
there seem to be some steps missing in this _BASELESS_ theory. Can anyone explain exactly HOW the _TOTD_ could possibly be used to _SPECEVILGOAL_?
if a _SPECJOBS_ had a _TOTD_ do you really think they'll be like "Hey, I know, let's all use this to _SPECEVILGOAL_!"? Really?
if a group of people wanted to _SPECEVILGOAL_, do you think it would be the _SPECJOBSPLURAL_ and not some other group? There seem to be a lot of holes in this idea
considering all the different things there are in the world, why use a _TOTD_ to _SPECEVILGOAL_? You'd think almost anything else would make sense
let's assume you start with a goal to _SPECEVILGOAL_. What would be the first step you could think of on that path to that _EVIL_ goal? Pretty sure it's not going to be "get a _TOTD_, right"?
so to get this straight, _SPECJOBSPLURAL_ are going to get a _TOTD_ and somehow that's going to let them _SPECEVILGOAL_?!
