it was becoming intermittently cloudy
the weather started to cool down
clouds started gathering
they could see a mist starting to gather in the treetops
it started raining
a howling wind was making it difficult to hear
pinpricks of cold were making them shiver
lightning split the air
sleet started coming down on them rapidly
the sun was shining and the skies were clear
it was warm and sunny
they welcomed the warm breeze
the temperature was very agreeable, not too hot and not too cold
it was the perfect weather to be out and about
