Deeds, not words
Love conquers all
To dare is to do
I came, I saw, I conquered
I am not led, I lead
In good faith
Tomorrow, be ours
What is said is done
Seize the wine
While there is life, there is hope
Seize the day
Family over everything
Love is the fountain of life
Wisdom is power
No honours without effort
Honey, I’m home!
Remember to live
Death before defeat
Dare to try
Peace be with you
Bravely and faithfully
Every beginning is difficult
Such is life
Today it’s me, tomorrow it will be you
Humility conquers pride
Through fire, nature is reborn whole
Let them hate so long as they fear
Out of chaos, comes order
Freedom will flood all things with light
One swallow does not make summer
Words fly away, writings remain
With hard work, all things increase and grow
Towards better things
In the absence of light, darkness prevails
Be still and know
How well, not how much
I challenge you
The time are changing, and we change in them
Need makes even the timid brave
Virtue strives for what is difficult
Every man is the artisan of his own fortune
A beard doesn’t make one a philosopher
Great is the power of habit
Nothing is arduous for the willing
No talk but action
To each his own
Mindful of what has been done, aware of what will be
Overcome evil with good
He who wants everything loses everything
He conquers who endures
For the good
Lead in order to serve, not in order to rule
May I not shrink from my purpose
To victory
